                        Drawing on the power of storytelling, it reveals the internal thoughts and external forces that shape her experience.


                        Abortion is a routine part of gyn care, yet medical education is often inadequate in abortion training.  Physicians may decline to be trained or face barriers to providing the procedure.  Thin Line shows how these realities and the unexplored biases of care providers affect women’s journey through the healthcare system.<br><br>


                        Thin Line challenges assumptions by illuminating the unseen parts of a woman’s story.  It is for a range of audiences, especially care providers and medical trainees who form the front lines of women’s healthcare.
