                        <p class="text-muted main-text">

                        Occasionally, virtual reality can bring on sensations of motion sickness.  We’ve designed the program to reduce this effect. Tightly fastening the goggles so that the images are clear will also help. Goggles should feel comfortable and not rest on the cheekbones. You may remove the goggles at any time if you feel uncomfortable. <br><br>

                        If you feel uncomfortable while going through the experience either because of the content or the device, feel free to stop and take the headset off.
