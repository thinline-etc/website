                        Occasionally, virtual reality can bring on sensations of motion sickness. We’ve design the program in a way to reduce this effect. Tightly fastening the goggles so that the images are clear will also help. Goggles should feel comfortable and not rest on the cheekbones. You may remove the goggles at any time if you feel uncomfortable.
